# 0.5.1

Using composition rather than inheritance for `ZombsoleGymEnv`.

# 0.5.0

Adding support for running the game using JSON over stdout and stdin. 
This makes it possible to run the game in a subprocess and submit actions 
using other programming languages.

# 0.4.0

Adding support for rendering with `OpenCV` and `PIL` (`pillow`).

# 0.3.1

The version was not updated for a significant period, and so this includes work 
done in the original repo, as well as changes such as refactoring as a library.
